1. Updated Modular Architecture (with AI-first focus)
Core Concept:

A modular software platform that allows users to sketch/doodle rockets or satellites on a touchscreen, then uses AI reasoning + aerospace models to:
Interpret the design
Generate specs (dimensions, thrust, payload, etc.)
Simulate feasibility of space missions (e.g., to the Moon)
Output manufacturing, cost, and engineering requirements

3. 1–2 Month Task Plan (Working Demo for Investors)
Goal for Demo:

User sketches rocket → AI interprets it → generates dimensions/specs → simulates basic trajectory → shows visualization + feasibility report.

Phase 1 (Week 1–2) – Foundations
✅ Set up project repo & folder structure
✅ Implement AI Orchestration Layer + base adapter class
✅ Add GPT-5 (or GPT-4 if easier now) as first working adapter
✅ Create dummy knowledge base (JSON with rocket specs)
✅ Build minimal Streamlit UI with canvas to upload doodle (simple line shapes)

Phase 2 (Week 3–4) – Doodle Parsing → Specs
Implement simple sketch parser (e.g., detect rocket body vs fins vs stages)
Connect parser → AI adapter → output "mock" rocket specs (length, mass, thrust placeholder)
Implement parametric modeler (rule-based + AI help for dimension scaling)
Add backend service: "Generate Rocket Spec Report"

Phase 3 (Week 5–6) – Physics + Mission Simulation
Implement basic thrust & mass calculation (rule-of-thumb equations)
Add orbital simulation stub (2-body simulation Earth ↔ Moon)
Link mission planner output → trajectory visualization (Matplotlib 2D path first)
Create report generator: specs + trajectory + feasibility text

Phase 4 (Week 7–8) – Investor Demo Polish
Improve UI: draw rocket → get instant 3D-ish visualization (simplified CAD via matplotlib/plotly)
Add Claude AI adapter to prove plug-and-play capability
Expand KB with real NASA/ESA rocket data for grounding
Integrate cost estimator (basic BOM with materials & cost curve)
Package investor demo (clean UI flow: sketch → specs → mission feasibility → cost report)

Long-Term Tasks (Post-Demo, Continuous Dev)
Integrate real CV model (OpenCV + Deep Learning for sketch parsing)
Expand physics engine (aerodynamics, staging, advanced propellant models)
Connect to CAD APIs (Fusion360, SolidWorks) for export
Build manufacturing pipeline integration (supply chain AI)
Fine-tune AI models on aerospace corpora (papers, specs, CAD)

✅ After 2 months → You’ll have a working demo where investors can:
Draw a rocket doodle → see specs & dimensions
Simulate a basic Moon mission trajectory
Get feasibility & cost breakdown
See AI orchestration with swappable models
