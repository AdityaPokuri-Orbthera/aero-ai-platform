Here’s a **top 20 tasks breakdown** prioritized from high to low to help you deliver a working MVP in 2–3 months and have something solid to demo to investors:

# Top 20 Tasks — AI-Powered Rocket Health & Autonomous Assist

## Phase 1 — Foundation (Weeks 1–3)
1. **Set up Kubernetes Cluster** (EKS/GKE/AKS or bare metal dev cluster) — baseline infra.
2. **Apply helmfile.yaml & bring up core services** (Kafka, Postgres, MinIO, Grafana, Prometheus).
3. **Configure Networking & Namespaces** (dev separation: `data`, `ml`, `observability`, `security`, `cicd`).
4. **Scaffold values/*.yaml files** with resource limits, persistence, dev secrets.
5. **Integrate Vault & Keycloak** for basic secret mgmt + identity.

## Phase 2 — Data Pipeline (Weeks 2–5)
6. **Implement Data Ingestion Service** — connect rocket telemetry simulator → Kafka topics.
7. **Create Schema Registry Contracts** (Protobuf/Avro schemas for telemetry, health metrics, events).
8. **Stream Processor v1** — Python/Flink/Rust microservice: consume telemetry, validate, push to Postgres + MinIO.
9. **ClickHouse Setup** — fast analytical store for time-series health data.
10. **Grafana Dashboards** — live rocket health visualization (CPU, temps, pressures, etc).

## Phase 3 — ML Enablement (Weeks 4–7)
11. **Deploy MLflow** for experiment tracking + model registry.
12. **Integrate Feast Feature Store** with telemetry data.
13. **Baseline Model Training** — anomaly detection / predictive maintenance model using simulated data.
14. **Model Deployment Service** — inference microservice (Python FastAPI) serving via Kafka or REST.
15. **Integrate OpenTelemetry Collector** — capture traces + link metrics/logs to inference pipeline.

## Phase 4 — CI/CD & Security (Weeks 6–9)
16. **Argo Workflows** for ML retraining pipeline (ingest → train → push model → deploy).
17. **Argo CD** for GitOps deployment (infrastructure + services).
18. **Basic RBAC & Network Policies** — lock down namespaces, limit pod-to-pod access.

## Phase 5 — Demo-Ready MVP (Weeks 8–12)
19. **Rocket Health Dashboard v1** — investor-facing Grafana + web frontend overlay.
20. **Scenario Demo** — run simulated rocket launch + anomaly → show detection + auto-response recommendation.
```

👉 With this list:

* First 5 tasks = infrastructure baseline (non-negotiable).
* Tasks 6–10 = data backbone (what makes your demo “real”).
* Tasks 11–15 = adds AI differentiation.
* Tasks 16–20 = polish + demo flow.

This sequencing gets you to an **investor-ready MVP in \~10–12 weeks**.

Do you want me to also map these tasks into a **week-by-week Gantt-style timeline** (2–3 months roadmap) so you can track progress visually?
