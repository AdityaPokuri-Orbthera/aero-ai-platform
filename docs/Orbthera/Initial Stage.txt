the full updated architecture + roadmap for your project, now focused on AI-first, swappable LLMs, and aerospace problem-solving (rockets, satellites, human space travel). I‚Äôve rebuilt the entire modular design, added the AI orchestration layer, and broken it into 5 phases so you can demo core features in 2‚Äì3 months but also grow into a long-term moonshot.

üåå AI-Powered Aerospace Design & Mission Platform
üéØ Vision

A platform where a user can sketch/doodle/dream a rocket or mission scenario, and the system transforms it into a real-world aerospace concept:

Converts doodles/inputs ‚Üí engineering dimensions, specs, materials, propulsion details.

Runs AI-assisted aerospace analysis ‚Üí trajectory, payload, feasibility.

Produces technical artifacts ‚Üí CAD-ready models, simulation inputs, and BOMs (bill of materials).

Supports plug-and-play AI models (GPT-5, Claude, Llama, custom aerospace-trained models).

Scales into a general-purpose AI co-pilot for rocket and satellite engineering ‚Üí ultimately solving problems for space travel.

üèóÔ∏è Modular Architecture
1. AI Orchestration Layer (Core)

Central layer for reasoning and decision-making.

Provides a standard interface (send_query(data), receive_response()).

Adapters for different models: GPT-5, Claude, Llama, in-house aerospace-tuned models.

Allows hot-swapping models without breaking other modules.

2. Input & Sketch Processing Module

Users can draw rockets, satellites, or mission paths on touchscreen or upload diagrams.

Doodle ‚Üí structured representation (shapes, dimensions, annotations).

Uses computer vision + AI prompt interpretation.

Outputs a structured Rocket/Vehicle Schema: dimensions, stages, payload bay, boosters, etc.

3. Parametric Modeling & Specs Generator

Converts schemas into engineering specs: thrust, weight, fuel capacity, aerodynamics.

Suggests materials (e.g., carbon composites, titanium).

Integrates with CAD APIs (Fusion360, SolidWorks) for future 3D modeling.

AI learns from real aerospace datasets (NASA, SpaceX, ESA, academic papers).

4. Mission Simulation & Planning Module

Takes rocket/vehicle specs and simulates missions:

Orbital insertion

Lunar transfer

Mars trajectory

Calculates Œîv, burn times, fuel requirements.

Integrates with open-source physics simulators (GMAT, Orekit, or custom).

AI provides "mission advisor" explanations (pros/cons of designs).

5. Knowledge Integration & Validation Layer

Embeds validated aerospace data ‚Üí propulsion tables, material properties, orbital mechanics.

AI uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) so answers are grounded in physics, not hallucinations.

Continuous updates with aerospace journals, research papers, and simulation data.

6. BOM & Feasibility Analyzer

Generates bill of materials (engines, tanks, avionics).

Estimates cost, sourcing options, and manufacturing feasibility.

Suggests trade-offs (lighter vs. cheaper vs. safer).

7. UI/Visualization & Collaboration

Interactive touchscreen interface for sketching + results.

Dashboards showing:

Rocket cross-sections

Material choices

Trajectories (3D orbit visualization)

Cost/feasibility metrics

Future: multiplayer collaboration (teams co-design rockets live).

‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

Core Logic: Python + Rust (performance-critical sim).

AI Hub: Model adapters (OpenAI GPT-5 API, Anthropic Claude, HuggingFace models, custom).

Data Infra: Postgres (designs, specs, missions) + Vector DB (Milvus/Weaviate) for aerospace embeddings.

Simulation: Orekit, GMAT, custom orbital mechanics modules.

UI: Streamlit/Dash (MVP), future ‚Üí WebGL + Three.js for 3D visualization.

Deployment: Docker, Kubernetes (later).

Cloud: AWS/GCP/Azure with GPU/TPU acceleration.

üõ°Ô∏è Security & Safety

Role-based access for collaborators.

Strict versioning of designs.

Data integrity checks for simulations.

Long-term: compliance with ITAR/EAR (export controls).

üìÖ Development Roadmap (5 Phases)
Phase 1 ‚Äì MVP (0‚Äì3 months)

üéØ Goal: Investor-ready demo ‚Äì user sketches rocket ‚Üí AI outputs specs + feasibility.

Build AI Orchestration Layer with GPT/Claude adapters.

Implement Sketch Processing ‚Üí Rocket Schema pipeline.

Implement Parametric Specs Generator with baseline aerospace knowledge.

Simple UI: touchscreen doodle ‚Üí text/graph output of rocket dimensions + specs.

Phase 2 ‚Äì Simulation Backbone (3‚Äì6 months)

Add Mission Simulation (basic orbital mechanics).

Integrate with Orekit/GMAT for Œîv calculations.

Expand material & propulsion database.

Add AI explanations (‚Äúthis design won‚Äôt reach orbit because thrust/weight < 1‚Äù).

Phase 3 ‚Äì CAD & Visualization (6‚Äì12 months)

Export rockets into CAD-friendly formats.

Add 3D visualization of rocket cross-sections.

Start BOM generator (engines, tanks, avionics).

UI upgrades with interactive mission path visualization.

Phase 4 ‚Äì Collaboration & Multi-AI (12‚Äì18 months)

Multi-user design sessions.

Plug in multiple AI models for ensemble reasoning (cross-check designs).

Add custom-tuned aerospace AI model.

Phase 5 ‚Äì Full Aerospace AI Co-Pilot (18+ months)

Autonomous advisor for full rocket/satellite lifecycle.

Suggest suppliers, manufacturing processes.

End-to-end Mission Feasibility Reports (cost, tech, timeline).

Platform evolves into AI R&D co-pilot for aerospace companies + agencies.

üîë First Steps (for you, solo dev, right now)

Build AI Orchestration Layer with 2 model adapters (OpenAI GPT + Claude).

Create schema definition for ‚ÄúRocket Design‚Äù (dimensions, stages, engines).

Prototype doodle ‚Üí schema using OpenCV + AI interpretation.

Wire UI (Streamlit or Touchscreen Canvas) to show sketch + AI-generated specs.

Demo: draw rocket ‚Üí get dimensions, thrust/weight, feasibility text output.

üëâ This way, you‚Äôll have a demo in 2‚Äì3 months while also laying the foundation for a long-term aerospace AI platform that can grow into something world-changing.

Do you want me to now draft the AI Adapter Interface spec + code stub (Python/Rust) so you can start building the AI Orchestration Layer right away? That‚Äôs the backbone to plug GPT/Claude/custom into everything else.
